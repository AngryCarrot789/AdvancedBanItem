# want to bypass a specific block, you could just add the limit's permission to yourself in pex... and this
# also IS NOT affected by "InvertPermissions" in the limits.yml config.
# and also this permission doesn't skip the world check. if you have bypass perms, but the block
# is disabled in the world (or if you dont have world bypass perms), you CAN NOT place the block.
