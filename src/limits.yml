#   ------------- EXAMPLE (with tons of description) ---------------------------------------------------------------
#   -- all of the IDs should just go in this config (aka keys). every ID must be a number with no letters,
#   -- and doing 12:-1 (-1 being metadata) wont work. you have to supply the metadata in the ID section (aka below)
#   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#    # the ID of the block to limit/ban (in game, use '/abi look' or '/abi hand'
#    # to get the block ID and metadata of the block youre looking at/holding in your hand)
#    12:
#      # the metadata that will be checked during events. if the event metadata is equal to any of the metadata below, it goes onto the next checks (permissions and stuff)
#      # -1 means its ignored, aka apply the limit to the entire ID regardless of metadata.
#      # if you dont supply any metadata, it will automatically add -1 for you, which affects the entire ID (regardless of metadata)
#      # this is for advanced control over banning the same ID but differnt metadata
#
#      # be aware with the metadata though. ItemStack metadata (aka items in your hand) and Block metadata (placed in a world)
#      # could be different. this is visible with spawners: a placed cow spawner might have ID 52 data 12, but the
#      # itemstack version in your hand might have the ID 52 data 92
#      MetaData:
#        # you supply the item/block metadata here
#        -1:
#          # a list of worlds that this item/block is NOT allowed in. trying to do anything with the block will not work in these worlds
#          # this is processed BEFORE permissions, so if the world isn't allowed, but the player has permissions, they can't place/break/etc it.
#          DisallowedWorlds:
#            - 'world'
#
#          # Inverts the worlds, meaning "Disallowed" becomes "Allowed".
#          # 'world' is disallowed, all other worlds are allowed. but if InvertWorlds is true,
#          # only 'world' is allowed, all others aren't allowed
#          InvertWorlds: false
#
#          # these permissions can be whatever you want, they could all be the same, or all different names, etc
#
#          # with these... leave it empty to allow it to always be placed/broken/interacted with
#          # otherwise, give the specified permission required to be broken.
#          # the permission required to place the block
#          # this means someone must have the advbanitem.place.sand to place sand blocks
#          PlacePermission: 'advbanitem.perms.limit.place.sand'
#
#          # same as above, but with breaking the block,
#          # this means someone must have the advbanitem.break.sand to break sand blocks
#          BreakPermission: 'advbanitem.perms.limit.break.sand'
#
#          # same above, but with interacting with it (right clicking / left clicking)
#          # this means that someone must have advbanitem.interact.sand to be able to right click or left click on sand
#          # if they dont have the permission, they CAN NOT right/left click on sand
#          # be aware though... interaction events are called first, then block break/place next
#          this isn't something a plugin can change, its a bukkit thing. so the player kinda needs interaction
#          # perms just to be able to place and/or break. to fix that, you could just not specify an interaction permissions, and it will only rely on the break/place permissions
#          # InteractPermission: 'advbanitem.perms.limit.interact.sand'
#
#          # inverts the limit's permissions. if this is false, it means the above comments are the same.
#          # meaning, they require the permissions above to be able to place/break the block. and if no permission is specified, they can place the block anyway
#          # however if this is true, it means someone with the permissions CAN NOT place/break the block, and it means someone without the permission CAN place the blocks,
#          # and it also means if the permission is empty, it means they CAN NOT place/break the block (because an empty permission means the block isn't disabled, but with permission activates the limit)
#          # basically, if this is true, the permission stops players placing/breaking/interacting, same with no permissions specified
#          # whereas if it was false, the permission allows the players to placing/breaking/interact, same with no permissions specified
#          InvertPermissions: false
#
#          # here is where you define the messages to be sent to a player when they try to do stuff with this item/block
#          # and because this is all defined in the metadata section, it lets you have different messages for different metadatas,
#          # instead of the same messages (you can do that with default stuff below though).
#          # if you dont supply a message, a default message will be used (below). if thats missing, it falls back to the config.yml values
#          # There are wildcards you can use in these messages (to get extra info). the available wildcards are:
#          #   (these 3 below are kinda useless you could just specify them yourself... but oh well)
#          #   %p - the place permission string
#          #   %b - the break permission string
#          #   %i - the interact permission string
#          #   %u - the player's username
#          #   %w - the name of the world the player is in
#          # Colours/Formats are also supported using the & symbol (and the other symbol). just make sure the value after the & is a valid colour code... because it'll show if it's not
#          # checking if the value is valid is skipped to increase performance (i mean a few extra microseconds isn't much... but eh)
#          # available colour/format codes are: 0123456789abcdefklmnor
#          NoPlaceMessage: '&6SAND!!! No placing!!'
#          NoBreakMessage: '&6SAND!!! No breaking!!'
#          NoInteractMessage: '&6SAND!!! No Interacting!!'
#
#          # the permission to pick up the block off the ground. these follow the same rules as the above permissions (interaction, etc), inversion will work on this
#          # however if you dont specify this, it will fall back to the interaction permission (aka they require permission to interact with the item to pick it up)
#          # and if the interaction permissions is empty, then this becomes empty and therefore is allowed :)
#          # not sure if that will be more inconvenient... but i'd find it handy so that i dont have to supply the pickup perms and interaction perms every time
#          PickupPermission: 'advbanitem.perms.limit.pickup.sand'
#
#          # the permission to interact with this block in your inventory. if you dont have this... it stops you moving the item
#          # around in your inventoy (clicking numbers wont move it in your hotbar as well). however, if you enable it in config.yml, perssing Q allows
#          # you to drop the item from your inventory (so it doesnt just get stuck requiring an admin with /invsee to remove it or something)
#          # this follows the same rule as PickupPermission, where if you dont specify it, it will instead use the interaction permission
#          InvClickPermission: 'advbanitem.perms.limit.pickup.sand'
#          # ------
#          # the permission fallback for the 2 above is:
#          # PickupPermission/InvClickPermission -> InteractionPermission -> DefaultInteractionPermission -> empty
#          # everything else is: Permission -> DefaultPermission -> empty
#
#          # these values do the same as permissions: they will fallback to the interaction message
#          # these messages can still use the above wildcards and colours/formats
#          # the message to send to the player if they try to pickup banned items off the ground
#          NoPickupMessage: '&4You cannot pickup sand!'
#          # the message to send the player if they try to click banned items in their inventory
#          NoInvClickMessage: '&4You cannot click sand in your inventory!'
#          # ------
#          # the message fallback for the 2 above is:
#          # NoPickupMsg/NoInvClickMsg -> NoInteractionMsg -> DefaultInteractionMsg -> fallback interaction msg
#
#      # if you dont supply the values above (permissions, messages, worlds, etc), they will fall back to these values below, called "default" values
#      # this means, every limited metadata above will have all the default values below, unless you supply values above. even if you use a few values above, it will fill in the rest.
#      # if there's nothing below, the messages will fall back to the ones in config.yml, disallowed worlds will be empty,
#      # invert worlds and permissions will be false, the permissions will be empty so there wont be a limit; anyone can place them
#      # these are handy when banning/limiting multiple metadatas. they can all use the default permissions, but you can add custom messages
#      # so basically, if you supply all of the avaliable stuff above and supply stuff below, none of the stuff below will be used

# here's an actual example i use for my server
# this bans the item ID 9065 but only with the metadata 31, 32, 33, 34, 35 and 36 (because these items are laggy)

# each metadata section would be a tad bit repetitive, and thats what default values aim to solve :))
